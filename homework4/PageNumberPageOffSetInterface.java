/**
 * Write a Java program called PageNumberAndOffsetFinder that implements this given interface.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The program calculates the page number and the page offset from a given virtual address and page size.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * This exercise will help you understand how memory is organized in a system that uses paging, a memory addressing mechanism.
 * In a system using paging, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called frames (pages). When a program accesses a memory address, that address is split into two parts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Page Number: Determines which page of memory the address is located in.</li>
 * <li>Page Offset: Determines the exact location within that page.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * Given:<br>
 * <p>
 * Virtual Address: A 32-bit virtual address.<br>
 * Page Size: The size of each page in bytes  as 512 bytes, 1024 bytes, 4096 bytes<br>
 * You will be required to calculate the page number and the page offset using the following two components:
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Page Number = Virtual Address / Page Size<br>
 * Page Offset = Virtual Address % Page Size<br>
 * <br>
 * As an example, your program would run as follows:
 * <br>
 * addresses 19986 for a page size of 4KB (4096 bytes)
 * <br>
 * page number = 4
 * <br>
 * offset = 3602
 * <br>

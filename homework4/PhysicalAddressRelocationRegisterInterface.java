/**
 * In this assignment, you will be implementing a system where we calculate the physical address given a virtual address, using a relocation register and a limit register.
 * <br>
 * The system should ensure that the virtual address is within the valid address range so that it is less than the value in the limit register.
 * <br>
 * If the address is invalid (i.e., the virtual address exceeds the limit), an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown.
 * <br>
 * Please review your notes and read the textbook to understand how limit registers and relocation registers are used to manage memory.
 * <br><br>
 * Now write a Java program called RelocationRegisterAddressTranslator that implements this given interface.
 * <br>
 * Your answer is submitted via zyBooks. You are allowed multiple submission. ZyBooks will autograde your submission.
